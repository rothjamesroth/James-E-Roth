# ⭐ Case Study: Building a Customer-Focused Engineering Support Center That Reduced Disposition Turnaround Time by 33%

## Overview
I was tasked with building and leading an Engineering Customer Support Center (CSC) focused on resolving aerospace component non-conformances. The directive from executive leadership was simple but ambitious:

“Work yourself out of a job — build a system that sustains itself and elevates the business.”

The initiative required not only technical problem solving but also organizational transformation. Success required aligning engineering decision-making with customer expectations, competitive strategy, and operational performance while maintaining strict safety and regulatory compliance.

## Early Leadership and Personal Growth
During my time as a student-athlete on the University of Mount Union Track and Field team. In 2018, I was part of a team that won back-to-back NCAA Division III National Championships, an experience that fundamentally shaped my understanding of leadership and team performance.

Our team entered both championship meets as unlikely contenders, qualifying fewer athletes than competing programs. Rather than relying on individual performance alone, our success was built on trust in our training program, accountability to one another, and a collective commitment to excellence. I embraced a leadership role by setting performance expectations through example, reinforcing belief in our preparation, and encouraging teammates to perform at their highest potential under pressure.

Every athlete on our team placed within the top four of their respective events, ultimately allowing us to secure the team championship in dramatic fashion during the final event, the 4x400-meter relay. I was a member of that relay team, and together we set both meet and school records, which stood until the succeeding Mount Union relay team later surpassed them.

This experience provided my first real understanding of what a high-performing culture looks like. I learned that sustained success is rarely the result of individual talent alone, but rather the product of shared purpose, disciplined execution, and trust in both the process and the team. That foundational lesson continues to influence how I build, lead, and empower teams today.

When I first stepped into a professional leadership role, I initially modeled my management style after what I had observed throughout the organization and what I knew from my past. I focused heavily on control, immediate-performance expectations, and direct oversight.

This approach produced unintended consequences:

- I micro-managed team execution  
- Engineers felt uncertain about their value and decision authority  
- Cross-functional teams found collaboration difficult due to my urgency-driven expectations  
- My team’s output quality and consistency suffered  
- I was working excessive hours trying to personally control outcomes  
- Rework remained high despite increased effort  

I saw that I needed to adapt my leadership approach. The turning point came when one of my top employees chose to leave the team. That moment forced me to step back and conduct a candid self-assessment of my leadership approach.

I took full ownership of the situation and committed to rebuilding the team environment intentionally. Drawing on leadership principles from my MBA education and research into high-performing organizations, I shifted toward an empowerment-driven, leader-leader model focused on clarity, accountability, and shared ownership of outcomes.

While I regret that the catalyst for change involved losing a valued team member, I am proud of the transformation that followed and the sustainable, engaged organization that emerged as a result.

This leadership evolution became foundational to the technical and operational success of the CSC.

## The Challenge
At the time of the CSC’s formation, the organization faced several systemic performance barriers:

- Average non-conformance disposition turnaround time (TAT): 60 days  
- Backlog of components awaiting engineering disposition: approximately 120 parts  
- Engineering decisions were largely experience-driven rather than strategy-driven  
- Inconsistent inspection rejection criteria created unnecessary engineering workload  
- Rework existed across inspection, engineering, and technical reporting processes  
- Limited data visibility prevented proactive performance management  
- Engineering decisions were not consistently aligned with customer or business strategy  

Although a scrap rate of approximately 10% was typical for aerospace MRO, opportu
