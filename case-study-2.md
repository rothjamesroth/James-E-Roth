# Technical Case Study: Engineering Solutions for Turbine Component Non-Conformances

## Overview

As a Product Support Engineer and later as Customer Support Center Engineering Manager, I evaluated and resolved complex non-conformances in turbine engine components. My work required technical analysis, mechanical engineering principles, statistical evaluation, process redesign, and collaboration with OEMs and cross-functional teams.

The goal was to ensure safe, compliant, and high-quality repairs, while improving operational efficiency and supporting development and approval of new repair methodologies, contributing to product delivery and repair execution.

## Key Projects

### 1. Low Pressure Turbine Case Rail – Wear Limits and Repair Development

#### Challenge:
Repetitive wear on the nozzle support was not defined in existing repair guidance. Without defined limits, decisions on repair or scrap were inconsistent, impacting production flow and component yield.

#### Approach:
- Researched similar product lines for geometric, material, and functional equivalence.
- Analyzed the typical condition, structural integrity, stiffness, and assembly impact to support a limit proposal.
- Presented analysis to customer and design authority representatives for review.

#### Outcome:
- Supported development and approval of revised service limits and repair methodology for nozzle support rail wear.
- Reduced non-conformance for the customer by ~20%, improving component yield and supporting operational efficiency.

### 2. Low Pressure Turbine Drive Shaft – Internal Mating Diameter Issue

#### Challenge:
Incidental material removal during repair posed potential risks.

#### Approach:
- Researched similar defects that were allowed as serviceable in the area.
- Analyzed stress caused by the allowed defect and compared to the geometry created by the incidental material removal.
- Provided technical analysis supporting approval of the repair condition.

#### Outcome:
- Supported development of a more robust substantiation package used in the approval cycle.
- Allowed safe repair of the defect and return to service.

### 3. High Pressure Compressor Case – Sealing Ring Mating Surface Issue

#### Challenge:
Incidental material removal during repair posed potential safety risks, freezing the component line until resolved.

#### Approach:
- Conducted dimensional and visual inspections of affected components.
- Reviewed condition against work records and identified three process failure points.
- Used statistical analysis (t-distribution) to support validation of previously processed components and assess risk.
- Collaborated with OEM design engineers for failure analysis.
- Led cross-functional efforts to redesign repair processes with CNC machining, controlled masking, and improved deburring procedures.

#### Outcome:
- Salvaged 75% of affected components, avoiding unnecessary scrap.
- Supported validation of all cases in use, preventing downtime situations and customer cost.
- Implemented new processes that resulted in 0 uncontrolled process findings across hundreds of subsequent repairs.

### 4. Low Pressure Turbine Case – Thermal Spray Flange Thickness Issue

#### Challenge:
Thermal spray repairs caused inconsistent flange thickness, potentially affecting assembly and performance.

#### Approach:
- Identified correlation between thickness variation and prior welding-induced distortion.
- Reviewed specifications tolerances for thickness and GD&T requirements and applied calculations to guide controlled material removal, ensuring compliance with repair direction and eliminating downstream issues.

#### Outcome:
- Eliminated the thickness issue in total. Saved lost TAT (multiple days) on 33% of cases.
- Achieved consistent repair results, reducing rework and improving operational efficiency.

### 5. Low Pressure Turbine Case – Specialized Welding Process

#### Challenge:
A unique case was received with a hole in the containment wall that required evaluation of a unique one-off repair utilizing specialized welding.

#### Approach:
- Supported definition of material removal and machining requirements.
- Coordinated with the welding process engineer to refine experimental parameters for successful welds and procured samples for parameter testing.
- Supported development of operator work instructions to perform the repair reliably.
- Contributed technical data supporting source substantiation and design authority approval, which included lab samples and testing.

#### Outcome:
- Supported successful implementation of a complex weld repair process with OEM approval.
- Ensured repeatable, safe, and compliant application, validating the process through experimental testing and parameter adjustments.

### 6. Non-Conformance Management - Process Monitoring and Evaluation

#### Challenge:
Repetitive damage patterns caused inefficiencies in non-conformance evaluation and delayed repair TAT.

#### Approach:
- Designed and implemented a statistical process monitoring system to categorize damage by feature, severity, and frequency.
- Guided the team in analyzing mechanical causes and prioritizing inspection and repair efforts.
- Used data to collaborate with engineers and support development of repair solutions for review by the OEM commercial leaders.

#### Outcome:
- Supported development and approval of multiple repair methods, including one blend repair affecting 20% of cases for a high-volume product line.
- Streamlined inspection and repair evaluation processes, improving data-driven decisions and operational efficiency.
