# ⭐ Technical Case Study: Engineering Solutions for Turbine Component Non-Conformances

## Overview

As a Product Support Engineer and later as Customer Support Center Engineering Manager, I evaluated and resolved complex non-conformances in turbine engine components. My work required technical analysis, mechanical engineering principles, statistical evaluation, process redesign, and collaboration with OEMs and cross-functional teams.

The goal was to ensure safe, compliant, and high-quality repairs, while improving operational efficiency and enabling new repair methods for issues, supporting product delivery and repair execution.
