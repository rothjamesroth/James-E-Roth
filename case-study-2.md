# Technical Case Study: Engineering Solutions for Turbine Component Non-Conformances

## Overview

As a Product Support Engineer and later as Customer Support Center Engineering Manager, I evaluated and resolved complex non-conformances in turbine engine components. My work required technical analysis, mechanical engineering principles, statistical evaluation, process redesign, and collaboration with OEMs and cross-functional teams.

The goal was to ensure safe, compliant, and high-quality repairs, while improving operational efficiency and enabling new repair methods for issues, supporting product delivery and repair execution.

## Key Projects

### 1. Low Pressure Turbine Case Ring 4 – Wear Limits and Repair Development

#### Challenge:
Repetitive wear on the Ring 4 nozzle support was not defined in the OEM manual. Without defined limits, decisions on repair or scrap were inconsistent, impacting production flow and component yield.

#### Approach:
- Researched similar product lines for geometric, material, and functional equivalence.
- Analyzed structural integrity, stiffness, and assembly impact to propose new service limits.
- Developed a substantiation package for a localized weld repair based on similarity to previously approved welds.
- Presented analysis to the customer engineering team for approval.

#### Outcome:
- Established new service limits and a repair method for Ring 4 wear.
- Reduced scrap rate for the customer by ~20%, improving component yield and supporting operational efficiency.

### 2. Low Pressure Turbine Drive Shaft – Internal Mating Diameter Issue

#### Challenge:
Incidental material removal during repair posed potential safety risks, and scrap of the component.

#### Approach:
- Researched similar defects that were allowed as serviceable in the area.
- Analyzed stress caused by the allowed defect and compared to the geometry created by the incidental material removal.
- Developed substantiation for material review board approval of the repair mistake.

#### Outcome:
- Served as a new approach to more robust material review board substantiation.
- Allowed safe repair of the defect and return to service.

### 3. High Pressure Compressor Case – Sealing Ring Mating Surface Issue

#### Challenge:
Incidental material removal during repair posed potential safety risks, freezing the component line until resolved.

#### Approach:
- Conducted dimensional and visual inspections of affected components.
- Reviewed condition against work records and identified three process failure points: machining, masking, and benching.
- Used statistical analysis (t-distribution) to validate previously processed components and assess risk.
- Collaborated with OEM design engineers for fatigue validation.
- Redesigned repair processes with CNC machining, controlled masking, and improved deburring procedures.

#### Outcome:
- Salvaged 8 of 12 affected components, avoiding unnecessary scrap.
- Validated all 18 on-wing cases, preventing aircraft on-ground situations and potential operational downtime/cost.
- Implemented new processes that resulted in 0 uncontrolled process findings across hundreds of subsequent repairs.

### 4. Low Pressure Turbine Case – Thermal Spray Flange Thickness Issue

#### Challenge:
Thermal spray repairs caused inconsistent flange thickness, potentially affecting assembly and performance.

#### Approach:
- Identified correlation between thickness variation and prior welding-induced distortion.
- Reviewed specifications tolerances for thickness and parallelism, and leveraged them by applying calculations to guide controlled material removal, ensuring compliance with repair direction and eliminating downstream issues.

#### Outcome:
- Eliminated the thickness issue in total. Saved lost TAT (~7 days) on 33% of cases.
- Achieved consistent repair results, reducing rework and improving operational efficiency.

### 5. Low Pressure Turbine Case – Electron Beam (EB) Welding Process

#### Challenge:
A unique case was received with a hole in it from loss of containment that required a new patch repair with electron beam (EB) welding.

#### Approach:
- Defined material removal and machining requirements.
- Coordinated with the EB welding process engineer to refine experimental parameters for successful welds. Procured samples for parameter testing.
- Developed finalized work instructions for operators to perform the repair reliably.
- Developed a source substantiation package to gain approval from the design authority to perform the repair, which included lab samples and testing.

#### Outcome:
- Successfully implemented a complex EB weld repair process with OEM approval.
- Ensured repeatable, safe, and compliant application, validating the process through experimental testing and parameter adjustments.

### 6. Non-Conformance Management - Process Control Charts and Evaluation

#### Challenge:
Repetitive damage patterns caused inefficiencies in non-conformance evaluation and delayed repair TAT.

#### Approach:
- Designed and implemented a statistical process control system to categorize damage by feature, severity, and frequency.
- Guided the team in analyzing mechanical causes and prioritizing inspection and repair efforts.
- Used data to collaborate with engineers and propose new repairs for review by the OEM material cost review board.

#### Outcome:
- Enabled development of multiple new repairs, including one blend repair affecting a quantity of 25+ cases per year for the businesses #1 product line.
- Streamlined inspection and repair evaluation processes, improving data-driven decisions and operational efficiency.
