# ⭐ Case Study: Building a Customer-Focused Engineering Support Center That Reduced Disposition Turnaround Time by 33%

## Overview

I was tasked with building and leading an Engineering Customer Support Center (CSC) focused on resolving aerospace component non-conformances. The directive from executive leadership was simple but ambitious:

**“Work yourself out of a job — build a system that sustains itself and elevates the business.”**

The initiative required not only technical problem solving but also organizational transformation. Success required aligning engineering decision-making with customer expectations, competitive strategy, and operational performance while maintaining strict safety and regulatory compliance.

## The Challenge

• Average non-conformance disposition turnaround time (TAT): 60 days  
• Backlog of components awaiting engineering disposition: approximately 120 parts  
• Engineering decisions were largely experience-driven rather than strategy-driven  
• Inconsistent inspection rejection criteria created unnecessary engineering workload  
• Rework existed across inspection, engineering, and technical reporting processes  
• Limited data visibility prevented proactive performance management  
• Engineering decisions were not consistently aligned with customer or business strategy  

---

## Strategic Approach

1. Safety, ethics, and regulatory compliance as non-negotiable foundations  
2. Alignment of engineering decisions with customer and competitive strategy  
3. Transition from knowledge-based decision making to data-driven systems  
4. Empowerment of engineers through clear expectations, accountability, and ownership

## Results

### Operational Performance

• Reduced disposition turnaround time from 60 days to 40 days (33% improvement)  
• Reduced engineering reporting rework by approximately 25%  
• Improved component yield and engineering resource efficiency

## Leadership Lessons

• Empowered team members make faster, higher-quality decisions  
• Technical excellence must align with business strategy  
• Data visibility transforms organizational performance  
• Culture and trust act as force multipliers  
• Leadership growth requires humility and self-reflection
